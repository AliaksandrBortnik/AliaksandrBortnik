## Self-intro
I'm Alex 👋🏼 and I have been working as a software engineer more than 10 years. I have took various positions on various projects such as a Full-stack developer, Front-end developer, Database Architect, ETL developer. Besides my engagement in the front & back-end development, I have hands-on experience in CI/CD configuration using Microsoft Azure DevOps, and the rest deployment stuff related to Azure cloud. In meantime, I constantly prefer to deepen my knowledge at diverse areas.
